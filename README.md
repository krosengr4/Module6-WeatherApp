## Description
- In the Weather Dashboard application, you can get the current weather as well as a 5 day forecast of a city. 

- For the current weather, the data displayed includes the temperature(degrees farenheight), wind speed(MPH), and humidity(%).
- For the five day forecast, the data displayed includes the data for the current weather, as well as the date and an emoji to represent the   weather conditions.

The application will also build and save the five most recent cities that the user has visited. The list of 5 cities are buttons for the user to click on and get the current and five day forecast for the city they clicked. 
The list of cities will be save if the user closes out of the application, and will be displayd again when the user reopens the application.

When the user loads into the application, the current and future conditions will display for the last city that the user searched for.
